2. REPORT DETAILS

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net alberto_reg[1]_i_1_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin alberto_reg[1]_i_1/O, cell alberto_reg[1]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net daniel_reg[2]_i_1_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin daniel_reg[2]_i_1/O, cell daniel_reg[2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net dispOut_reg[7]_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin dispOut_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell dispOut_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net enable_reg_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin enable_reg_i_2/O, cell enable_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net nextState_reg[3]_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin nextState_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell nextState_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net rs_reg_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin rs_reg_i_2/O, cell rs_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net state_reg[3]_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin state_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell state_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net timeToWait_reg[21]_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin timeToWait_reg[21]_i_2/O, cell timeToWait_reg[21]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
